/* The sky behind the sheets: the wiki's starfield, so the two sites sit in the
 * same space. This is the wiki's docs/javascripts/starfield.js with three
 * changes - the classes are this site's, the sheets' own "reduced motion"
 * setting (Settings, data-motion on <html>) holds the sky still and stops the
 * comets, and the sky is one sky for the whole app, since every page
 * here is the same address. Change the look in the wiki first, then here.
 *
 * The setting is a spelljamming campaign, so the page sits in space rather
 * than on a flat colour. Nothing here is an image file: every star and every
 * nebula is computed in the browser at load, which keeps the page weight at a
 * few kilobytes of script instead of a wallpaper, and lets the sky redraw at
 * whatever size and pixel density the reader's screen actually is.
 *
 * How it works, in the order it happens:
 *
 * 1. A seed is derived from the page's own URL path. The same page therefore
 *    gets the same sky every visit, on every machine, while two pages get
 *    different skies - each article is its own region of space. The seed
 *    drives a small deterministic generator (mulberry32), so "random" here is
 *    reproducible rather than different on every reload.
 *
 * 2. Three star layers are drawn, far to near, each on its own canvas so it
 *    can be moved independently. Star count scales with the area of the
 *    viewport, so a wide monitor is not sparser than a laptop.
 *
 * 3. Nebulae are radial gradients, a handful per sky, positioned and coloured
 *    from the same seed, drawn under the stars at low alpha.
 *
 * 4. Every layer is painted at twice the viewport width, with each element
 *    drawn twice - once at x and once at x + width. That makes the layer
 *    seamless when it slides: panning it from 0 to -width and resetting is
 *    invisible, because the second copy is already in position. The sky drifts
 *    continuously, each layer at its own speed, which is what gives it depth.
 *
 * 5. Scrolling adds a vertical offset to the same transform, at a different
 *    rate per layer. Nothing is ever repainted - only a CSS transform changes -
 *    so a ten-thousand-word page stays cheap to scroll.
 *
 * The sky does not change between light and dark mode. It is the same space in
 * both; only the cards on top of it change.
